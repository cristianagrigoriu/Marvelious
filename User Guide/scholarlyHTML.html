        <h2>1 What is the app in short? - Abstract</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvelous App aims to present a complex visualisation of the Marvel Comic Universe. Both people who don't know the comics and die-hard fans will get the chance to interact, search and find out information about the characters and the events tying them up. The app is a fun and interesting way to discover the Marvel characters, through means of Virtual Reality, Timelines and Interactive Design.

        <h2>2 Why do we do it? - Motivation</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvel Universe is inherently complex. With a multitude of characters and actions spanning several years and continents, it is difficult to know where to start or who interacts with whom. The movies don't cover all of the information and reading all the comics takes time. For poeple who have never interacted with the universe, the task to get to know it seems daunting, and die-hard fans would like an outlet to share all their knowledge.
        </p>
		<p>
			Our solution aims to bridge this gap, by offering an interactive and easy way to discover the universe. We propose several solutions, of different complexities, aimed at different types of users, to help them understand the relationships between the characters. It is also a pleasant way of following your passion and could help build the hype before a new movie release.

            <h2>3 How to get started? (Installation Guide)</h2>
			
			<h4>The web application is live, therefore it works on desktop equipped with a browser - it was tested on a mobile device, although it does not work as good as on desktop. The app will look and behave slightly different when used in different browsers. There is no requirement as regards the operation system. </h4>
			<h4>The app can be accessed through <a href="https://cristianagrigoriu.github.io/Marvelious/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</h4>

			<h2>4 What do we have here?</h2>
				<h4>Home Screen - Presentation of main tabs and their roles, user options from home screen</h4>
				<img src="./css/images/home_screen.png" alt="Home Screen">
				<p>The user is able to see the three main tabs that help organize the information: <strong>Events</strong>, <strong>Comics</strong> and <strong>Heroes</strong>. The information contained in each tab is self-explanatory. Once the user selects his/her option, the data regarding each tab is loaded and displayed in the screen below.</p>
				<img src="./css/images/comics_timeline.png" alt="Comics Timeline">
				<p>The user sees the information ordered chronologically, by year, with the most recent information on top. Clicking on a picture, he/she can also read more details about that specific item.</p>
				<p>The user also has the option to scroll directly to the Bottom or back to the Top.</p>

			<h2>5 What can we do - USE CASE 1</h2>
			<h4>The task is: Navigate to a certain character e.g.:Alex Power.</h4>
				<p>The user navigates to the <strong>Heroes</strong> tab.</p>
				<img src="./css/images/heroes.png" alt="Heroes">
				<p>The user then scrolls through the heroes to find the desired one. They are ordered alphabetically. If he doesn't find it, he can click on <strong>Load more</strong> to find new ones.</p>

			<h2>8 How can we make the app more user-friendly?</h2>
			<h4>The users that tested in application suggested the following improvements:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Add a Search button</li>
				<li>Introduce filters for the information, in order to sort by year, hero series, user language, relevance</li>
				<li>Reduce the waiting time by loading and displaying only the first page of the application, leaving the rest to load in the background.</li>
			</ul>

        <h2>8 Where can we go from here? - Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The next steps after the implementation of the chosen solution would be to extend it with various features to make the application more engaging and more useful.
			In conclusion, this first version is a MVP which will present the marvelious data in a friendly and useful way to the users. It is also a pleasant way of following your passion and stay up to date with all the new updates in the Marvel universe.</p>
