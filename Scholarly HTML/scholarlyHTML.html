        <h2>1 What is the app in short? - Abstract</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvelous App aims to present a complex visualisation of the Marvel Comic Universe. Both people who don't know the comics and die-hard fans will get the chance to interact, search and find out information about the characters and the events tying them up. The app is a fun and interesting way to discover the Marvel characters, through means of Virtual Reality, Timelines and Interactive Design.

        <h2>2 Why do we do it? - Motivation</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvel Universe is inherently complex. With a multitude of characters and actions spanning several years and continents, it is difficult to know where to start or who interacts with whom. The movies don't cover all of the information and reading all the comics takes time. For poeple who have never interacted with the universe, the task to get to know it seems daunting, and die-hard fans would like an outlet to share all their knowledge.
        </p>
		<p>
			Our solution aims to bridge this gap, by offering an interactive and easy way to discover the universe. We propose several solutions, of different complexities, aimed at different types of users, to help them understand the relationships between the characters. It is also a pleasant way of following your passion and could help build the hype before a new movie release.
