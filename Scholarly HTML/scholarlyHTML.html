        <h2>1 What is the app in short? - Abstract</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvelous App aims to present a complex visualisation of the Marvel Comic Universe. Both people who don't know the comics and die-hard fans will get the chance to interact, search and find out information about the characters and the events tying them up. The app is a fun and interesting way to discover the Marvel characters, through means of Virtual Reality, Timelines and Interactive Design.

        <h2>2 Why do we do it? - Motivation</h2>
        <p>
			The Marvel Universe is inherently complex. With a multitude of characters and actions spanning several years and continents, it is difficult to know where to start or who interacts with whom. The movies don't cover all of the information and reading all the comics takes time. For poeple who have never interacted with the universe, the task to get to know it seems daunting, and die-hard fans would like an outlet to share all their knowledge.
        </p>
		<p>
			Our solution aims to bridge this gap, by offering an interactive and easy way to discover the universe. We propose several solutions, of different complexities, aimed at different types of users, to help them understand the relationships between the characters. It is also a pleasant way of following your passion and could help build the hype before a new movie release.

			<h3>4 Who will use it? - Persona Templates</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Die-hard fan</li>
					<p>
						We target this category of users as they are the ones who would show the most interest for this kind of app. The main goals for this user would be to be able to search specific information and be able to easily skip the basic details about heroes, stories and other Marvel entities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping in mind the needs of this type of user, the application should provide a complex search function that can filter entities chronologically and by category. The information should be presented in an interesting way that displays a few of the Marvel comics style, in order to please the esthetic expectancies of a MCU connoisseur.
                    </p>
					<li>Kid fan</li>
                    <li>Newbie to the MCU</li>
                    <p>
                        For this type of user, the application should be intuitive and not overcrowded with specific or detailed information. A basic structure of the Marvel Universe should be easy to understand at a first glance and detailed information should be displayed on request (e.g. pressing a "More" button).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using the app the newbie's interest for Marvel could grow and, in time, they could become part of our first category of users, the die-hard fans.
                    </p>
					<li>Parent of interested child</li>
					<p>
						We imagined that a person interested in the app would also be the parent who wants to give it as a present to their son/daughter. Before buying it, they would be curious to at least know what it is, so they might try to experiment with it. The idea is to design a product as user-friendly as possible, in order not to "scare them away."
					</p>
					<p>
						The typical parent would be over 30, would have a minimum to average computer savviness and would have a minimum to average forehand knowledge of the Marvel Universe. They probably won't have that much time either, so what is important for them is:
						<ul>
						 <li>to be impressed from the beginning, to see something new and "worth their money"</li>
						 <li>to be able to search fast for characters</li>
						 <li>to find an appropriate content for their teenage children</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</ol>

			<h3>5 How do we know the user? - QOC Method</h3>
				<p>
                    The QOC (Question, Options and Criteria) method structures the creative process in a way that is not only practical, but also helps us to think and observe the application from a user's point of view. 
                    The questions we chose are targeting our most important categories of users and their prefered app functions.
                    For each question, the criterias reflect the pain points or interests of certain user categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By evaluating the designs in this way we have a way of measuring the way each idea suits the users. This allows us to further refine each idea and even combine them, if possible, to pick the best one for each use case.

			<h3>6 How does it look like? - Visualisation Examples - sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, optionally, prototypes</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Vertical Scroll</li>
					<li>Augmented Reality Real Life Situation</li>
					<li>Hero Carousel</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>Vertical Scroll</h4>
				<h4>Augmented Reality Real Life Situation</h4>
				<p>
					The idea behind this concept is that the easiest way for people to get to know one another and to exchange information is through <strong> direct speech and interaction</strong>. Therefore, using Augmented Reality, our users will be able to imerse themselves into the Marvel Universe, talk to their different heroes and take part, beside them, in legendary battles.
				</p>
				
				</=figure>
					<img src="./css/images/marvelious-vr-storyboard.png" alt="Augmented Reality Storyboard">
					<figcaption>An example of a use case of the AR Marvelious by a teen fan.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>
					The hero enters a space with all of its heroes. He can navigate through them, he can select if he wants to interact with one or more at a time and he can choose a moment in time and a place. He can also choose to "Jump in!" directly in the action, where he has the superhero's perspective on things. He can jump across skyscrapers along with Spider-Man, fly along Iron Man or shrink together with Ant Man. He can control all of his actions through direct speech and his movements and actions through the movement of his body. If he has questions about the characters, he can ask them directly. 
				</p>
				
				<center></=figure>
					<img src="./css/images/Main Screen.png" alt="Augmented Reality Main Screen Wireframe">
					<figcaption text-align:center;>AR Marvelious Wireframe - The Superhero Main Screen</figcaption>
				</figure></center>
				
				<p>
					As shown in the picture above, in the Augmented Reality world, the user can see and talk to a user, can choose the time, place and characters he is curious about and he can also opt for a narration of that hero's story, if he doesn't want to read it.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Hero Carousel</h4>
				<p>
                    This design idea aims to provide a simple and intuitive way of representing the Marvel main characters. The application is based on more main pages, one for each type of entity provided by the Marvel API. The carousel is not only present for the heroes, but also for the authors or the comics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relations between entities of different types are represented in each entity's own page. For example, when accessing a hero's page, we see not only details about them, but also, what comics and stories he belongs to or the main events that he has been part of. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design aims to satisfy both the newbie users and the die-hard ones. For the first category it offers a simple structure, easy to navigate, for all the information provided by the API. For the latter, there is a complex search and filtering function provided so that they do not have to go through all the basic knowledge each time and instead go straight to the specific data that interests them.

        <h2>7 Where can we go from here? - Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The next steps after the implementation of the chosen solution would be to extend it with various features to make the application more engaging and more useful.
			In conclusion, this first version is a MVP which will present the marvelious data in a friendly and useful way to the users. It is also a pleasant way of following your passion and stay up to date with all the new updates in the Marvel universe.</p>
