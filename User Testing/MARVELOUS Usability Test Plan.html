			<h3>Test Plan for: <span>MARVELOUS Application</span></h3>
			
			<div class="usabilityTestBackground">				
				<h4>Persona Type Tested: <span>Secondary</span></h4>
				<h5>Context: <span>an environment (location) where the user is comfortable without distractions</span> </h5>
				<h5>Duration: <span>XX minutes</span></h5>
				<p>Complete the following before starting: <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/testingscript.html">Greeting and Consent</a> &amp; <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/userbackground.html">User Background Information</a>.</p>

		<div class="usabilityTestObjectives">
				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<p>The overall goal of this test is to check the accessibility and ease of use of the application for both users who are familiar with the MARVEL universe and for users who are not. In particular, we want to focus on the following aspects:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Assess the overall effectiveness of the <strong>application</strong> for different types of users performing basic, common tasks;</li>
					<li>Identify obstacles to completing <strong>a certain task or using a certain component</strong>;</li>
					<li>Evaluate consistency and standards;</li>
					<li>Check if users identify the main user flows of the application and follow them;</li>
				</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>You come home after work one day. You want to relax and learn something new. You open the MARVELOUS application and you want to explore it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestDetails">
			<div class="detailsLeft">
				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Open the main screen of the application</br>
							<strong>Estimated time:</strong> 0,1 min</li>
						<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Navigate through the main screen, to get familiar with it</br>
							<strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 min</li>
						<li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Navigate to the character "ALEX POWER". Read information about him.</br>
							<strong>Estimated time:</strong> 3 min</li>
						<li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Get back to the mainscreen and check out all the events from the year 2010.</br>
							<strong>Estimated time:</strong> 1 min</li>
					</ul>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>			
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How was the overall user experience?</li>
						<li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What did you find most enjoyable?</li>
						<li><strong>Question 3:</strong> What tasks did you have trouble with? What would you improve?</li>						
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

		<h3>Test Results for: Application</h3>
		<h4>Success Criteria</h4>
		<p>A successful design has been achieved when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Under 5% of the users are met with a bug in the application.</li>
			<li>70% of the users are able to find the information they need in under 50 seconds.</li>
			<li>80% of the users are able to navigate smoothly through the application.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Finding 1: Most users found the experience enjoyable and relevant and praised the visual design.</li>
			<li>Finding 2: Most of the users liked the design and the described the user experience as good.</li>
			<li>Finding 3: All of the users found improvements that can be done to the app, such as adding a Search button and organising some of the information in a more relevant manner.</li>

			<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is an issue with the design. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>

		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
			<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
			<p>Expected answers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>How was the overall user experience?</strong> Pleasant, intuitive, I would use the application on a regular basis.</li>
				
				<li><strong>What did you find most enjoyable?</strong></li> The design, the easy interaction with the app, the content.
				<li><strong>What tasks did you have trouble with? What would you improve?</strong> Scrolling takes a lot of time. Faster response times.</li>	
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
			<h5>Test Observations</h5>
			<p>User didn't understand the long waiting time for the page to load. User had ease accessing the application and navigating through it. The users found relevant information and liked the presentation as intuitive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="otherDetails">
			<h5>Potential Design Improvements</h5>
			<p>A Search button might be added. Filters are also considered an improvement, to help organize the information by series, by language, by edition, by relevance. For years, an option to Expand/Hide might be also useful. Also, an advice would be to talk to Marvel fans to find out what would they want to find in such an application.</p>
