					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Bianca has to divide her time between <strong>being a parent</strong> and being a key-person at her job. Having <strong>worked at ING for more than 7 years</strong>, she has climbed the management ladder and is now being asked for advice by her other colleagues, because her door is always open. She has one son, Alex, with whom she is quite close. Because Alex is starting to become an adolescent, she wants to understand him and be there for him during this time.</p>

					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Some of the difficulties the user has with the product.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>VR is a new area for Bianca, that she never interacted with</li>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Having been in charge of the transition to the new auditing software in the bank, Bianca is quite <strong>computer-savvy</strong>. She enjoys configuring the software and finding out its new features. However, she is <strong>overwhelmed by the many new electronic devices</strong> her son has and leaves their maintenance to her husband, as after work she wants to relax, have a good meal and maybe watch a movie.</p>
				<p>Her son, on the other hand, is obsessed with the Marvel Universe. He is always asking her to go to the movies and to buy the comics. Bianca is trying to find an <strong>efficient solution</strong> in order not to be have to buy him these every week. If she finds a nice presentation of all the characters, she might also have a look at it, out of curiosity.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, she wants her son to be happy and a chance for them to <strong>interact more</strong>.</p>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Bianca has just finished a 10-hour work day and she is going home. She passes by the comic book store and sees an attractive commercial in front: "Get to know the entire Marvel Universe at a glance". Although tired, she decides to enter and give it a go. The shop assistant is very persuasive and has her try on the VR Goggle. She immediately picks up what she has to do and is enjoying the experience. 15 minutes later, she comes out of the shop, satisfied about the present she just got for her son.</p>
