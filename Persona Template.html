				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Having been in charge of the transition to the new auditing software in the bank, Bianca is quite <strong>computer-savvy</strong>. She enjoys configuring the software and finding out its new features. However, she is <strong>overwhelmed by the many new electronic devices</strong> her son has and leaves their maintenance to her husband, as after work she wants to relax, have a good meal and maybe watch a movie.</p>
				<p>Her son, on the other hand, is obsessed with the Marvel Universe. He is always asking her to go to the movies and to buy the comics. Bianca is trying to find an <strong>efficient solution</strong> in order not to be have to buy him these every week. If she finds a nice presentation of all the characters, she might also have a look at it, out of curiosity.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, she wants her son to be happy and a chance for them to <strong>interact more</strong>.</p>

She passes by the comic book store and sees an attractive commercial in front: "Get to know the entire Marvel Universe at a glance". Although tired, she decides to enter and give it a go. The shop assistant is very persuasive and has her try on the VR Goggle. She immediately picks up what she has to do and is enjoying the experience. 15 minutes later, she comes out of the shop, satisfied about the present she just got for her son.</p>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p> Tudor has <strong>little to no experience with the web applications</strong>, but he enjoys everything that's new, especially if it is about a subject
					that interests him. The best applications are the ones who are <strong>user friendly</strong> so that from the first try he can get the information he needs,

		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>He just saw the Captain America movie at the cinema and he loved it. His friends at school already saw it and were talking about it, so Tudor wants to 
				find out more information about the main character that he admires now. He will also be able to join the conversation and maybe even impress his group
				of friends. 
				<br/>He goes home and, searching for Captain America, he finds the Marvelous application. The character has all the details right next to him
				and there's a comic about it too! There's a whole Universe, actually! The connections with the other characters will surely impress Dan, who always 
				brags with his knowledge about superheroes.
				<br/>Tudor reads not only the information about Captain America, but also some about the other characters he has now discovered.
